The following files were converted from an import that was stored lossy.
You may lose fidelity when re-importing these files upon loading the project.

------

The following files were converted and saved to a non-original path, but did not have their import data rewritten.
These files will not be re-imported when loading the project.
res://.godot/imported/icon.svg-218a8f2b3041327d8a5756f3a245f83b.ctex to res://.assets/icon.png

Use Godot editor version 4.2.2 to edit the project.
Note: the project may be using a custom version of Godot. Detection for this has not been implemented yet.
If you find that you have many non-import errors upon opening the project 
(i.e. scripts or shaders have many errors), use the original game's binary as the export template.
