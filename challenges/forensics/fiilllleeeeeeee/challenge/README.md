I plugged in a USB and it encrypted my files. Luckily I had the initiative to take an image of the USB after the encryption occurred (`fiilllleeeeeeee.ad1`). Can you find a way of decrypting my most important file (`flag.txt`)?

Note: The ransomware in the image should be harmless as it only targets a specific directory that is incredibly unlikely to exist by chance.
